    Oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh-oh
    Ah-ah
    Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
    But the very next day, you gave it away
    This year, to save me from tears
    I'll give it to someone special
    Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
    But the very next day, you gave it away (you gave it away)
    This year, to save me from tears
    I'll give it to someone special (special)
    Once bitten and twice shy
    I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
    Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
    Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
    "Merry Christmas, " I wrapped it up and sent it
    With a note saying, "I love you, " I meant it
    Now I know what a fool I've been
    But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again
    Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
    But the very next day, you gave it away (you gave it away)
    This year, to save me from tears
    I'll give it to someone special (special)
    Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
    But the very next day, you gave it away
    This year, to save me from tears
    I'll give it to someone special (special)
    A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
    I'm hiding from you, and your soul of ice
    My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
    Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
    A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
    A man undercover, but you tore me apart
    Ooh-hoo
    Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again
    Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
    But the very next day, you gave it away (you gave it away)
    This year, to save me from tears
    I'll give it to someone special (special)
    Last Christmas, I gave you my heart (I gave you my heart)
    But the very next day, you gave it away (you gave it away)
    This year, to save me from tears
    I'll give it to someone special (special)
    A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)
    A man undercover, but you tore him apart
    Maybe next year, I'll give it to someone
    I'll give it to someone special (special!)
    So long!
